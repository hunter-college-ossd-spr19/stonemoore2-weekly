## Free vs Open Source Software  

Free software and open source software share many similarities and is most cases software that qualifies as one also qualifies as the other. After reading [The Open Source Initiative's Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd) and [The Free Software Foundation's Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) the difference between the two was not quite clear to me. There are, however a few key differences that distinguish the two which are explained in [Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html). Aside from throwing some major shade at proponents of open source, the page explains that open source software has a looser definition than free software meaning that software can qualify as open source without meeting the qualifications to be considered free. For example, open source DRM software would have source code that is accessible and modifiable in order to produce a more robust set of restrictions. This, however, would go against the principles of free software which state that software should not restrict the users from using other types of software. Software that has restrictions on the distribution of modified versions of it may also be considered open source but not free. In general, free software puts the power in the hands of the users and allows them to do as they please with almost no restriction. The freedom is more comprehensive than that which comes with an open source license.
  
## OpenStreetMap Edits
  
I made my first few edits to OpenStreetMap seen [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/stonemoore2/history#map=15/40.6398/-73.8856). I saw that the skatepark that I go to near my house didn't even have a designated so I made one and filled it with what I knew about it. Then I added some of the store names to a nearby strip mall. It turns out that I made the mistake of clustering a few unrelated edits into one changeset. Whoops. I think I made up for it by making a few extra edits. There was a parking lot area on top of a building so I fixed that. I also added some missing basketball courts in the nearby park. Working in OpenStreetMap was surprisingly engaging.
