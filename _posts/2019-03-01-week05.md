## Possible projects
  
Choosing an open source project to contribute to in no easy task. There are many things to consider when making this decision. Finding projects to contribute in the first place is pretty hard. I ultimately identified a projects I might be interested in contributing to. DuckDuckGo's Instant Answers seems like something that would be cool. It's definitely a useful feature and something that I can see myself using. People make use of similar things all the time in more prominent search engines like Google and Bing. In fact I'm considering switching to using DuckDuckGo myself because of its greater focus on privacy and security. Aside from that I don't really know what I want to put my time into. I'll have to spend more time looking through possible projects to contribute to in the future.
