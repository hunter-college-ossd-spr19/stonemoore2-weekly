## Git Commands
  
This week we focused on familiarizing ourselves with git commands and a typical workflow for contributing to a project that many are working on. The refresher was very helpful because although I have used git in the past, I had forgotten some of the finer details and the nuances that one should keep in mind when using it. We did a little activity to get used to using it in which we split up into groups and added some nonsense files to a repository. In a strange way, it was kind of fun.
 
## First Project Contributions
  
A person’s first contributions to an open source project should be something that they are very comfortable with whether it is because the task is something that they have a lot of experience with or just something simple. It follows then that my first contribution to a project will probably not be the addition of some complex code block but rather something simple like clarifying documentation or calling attention to a certain issue that has previously been unaddressed. One should also make sure that they truly care about the project that they are contributing to and not just doing it merely for the sake of contributing.  Otherwise, one will not put their best effort into making the highest quality contributions they can. Knowing this, I’d probably want to contribute to something that I’m passionate about such as gaming or animation.
