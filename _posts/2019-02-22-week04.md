## Project Evaluation pt. 2
  
As I said during the previous post, the project evaluation assignment was time-consuming and I didn't really see the value in it. If I were to evaluate projects for myself I'd approach it quite differently. I'd still make sure the languages used are ones that I'm familiar with and check the license and code of conduct. Besides that, if the project is reasonably active, I'd just make sure I understand the code in order to be sure of what I'm doing. As long as the issues and pull requests have reasonable a chance of being reviewed it doesn't really matter how long it takes. It also doesn't matter if the people in charge are friendly or not.
