My name is Stone but people call me Stone. I chose my major by flipping a five Hong Kong dollar coin multiple times so now I'm studying CS at Hunter. I graduated from Stuyvesant in 2015 and should be graduating from Hunter this year. When I was younger I used to make bad flash animations so if you've ever seen some stick figure stuff made by some dude named frNME that was me.  
I look forward to watever projects I'll be working on in this class.
