My name is Stone (yes that's the birth name). I chose my major by flipping a five Hong Kong dollar coin multiple times so now I'm studying CS at Hunter. I graduated from Stuyvesant in 2015 and should be graduating from Hunter this year. When I was younger I used to make bad flash animations so if you've ever seen some stick figure stuff on the internet made by some dude named frNME that was me. Eveb so, animation is a passion of mine and I'm very into both western and japanese animation. Occasionally I make something myself as well. I've been coding since 10th gradeand find it fun and engaging.  
  
I look forward to watever projects I'll be working on in this class.
